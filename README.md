# verify-and-update-version

GitHub action to verify the version tag and release have the same name, and
update the major version tag, when there's a new latest release.

When you're publishing a release with a semantic version, you should:

1. Manually create a new tag with the semantic version.
2. Make sure the tag matches the release name exactly, so there's no confusion
   about the distinction between a tag (a Git feature) and a release (a GitHub
   feature).
3. If the release isn't a prerelease\*, and it's the latest version, update the
   major version tag to point to the current commit.

> Example: if you publish a latest release v1.2.3, you should create a new tag
> v1.2.3 when creating the release, and update the tag v1 to point to the same
> commit as v1.2.3.

It's a hassle to manually check that the tag and release are the same, delete
the old major version tag, and create a new major version tag referencing the
current commit. So this action does all that automatically every time there's a
new latest release.

> \*For the release to not be a prerelease, it (1) shouldn't be labeled as a
> prelease and (2) shouldn't have a suffix, like -alpha (ex. v1.2.3-alpha).
>
> \*\*[GitHub generally wants version tags prefixed with v](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-tags-for-release-management)
> (ex. v1.2.3 instead of 1.2.3), and this action enforces that convention
> strictly. In other words, this action will intentionally fail if you don't
> prefix a version tag with v.

## Usage
